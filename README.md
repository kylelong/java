- If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of the word, 
then add ay to the end of the word. Examples: pig →→ igpay, there →→ erethay.

- If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), simply add yay to the end of the word. For this problem, y is always a vowel. 
 Examples: and →→ andyay, ordinary →→ ordinaryyay.
